    track: 'Piano Man',
    lyrics: 'It\'s nine o\'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in There\'s an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin He says, "Son can you play me a memory I\'m not really sure how it goes But it\'s sad and it\'s sweet And I knew it complete When I wore a younger man\'s clothes" Sing us a song you\'re the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well we\'re all in the mood for a melody And you\'ve got us feeling alright Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he\'s quick with a joke or to light up your smoke But there\'s someplace that he\'d rather be He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me" As a smile ran away from his face "Well, I\'m sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place" Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he\'s talking with Davy, who\'s still in the Navy And probably will be for life And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes they\'re sharing a drink they call loneliness But it\'s better than drinking alone Sing us a song you\'re the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well we\'re all in the mood for a melody And you\'ve got us feeling alright It\'s a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile \'Cause he knows that it\'s me they\'ve been coming to see To forget about life for a while And the piano sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say "Man what are you doing here?" Sing us a song you\'re the piano man Well we\'re all in the mood for a melody And you\'ve got us feeling alright' },

    lyrics: 'Elsa? Do you wanna build a snowman? Come on lets go and play I never see you anymore Come out the door It\'s like you\'ve gone away- We used to be best buddies And now we\'re not I wish you would tell me why!- Do you wanna build a snowman? It doesn\'t have to be a snowman. Go away, Anna Okay, bye... Do you wanna build a snowman? Or ride our bikes around the halls I think some company is overdue I\'ve started talking to the pictures on the walls- Hang in there, Joan! It gets a little lonely All these empty rooms, Just watching the hours tick by- Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock Elsa? Please, I know you\'re in there, People are asking where you\'ve been They say "have courage", and I\'m trying to I\'m right out here for you, just let me in We only have each other It\'s just you and me What are we gonna do?

    track: 'The Star Spangled Banner',
    lyrics: 'Oh, say can you see by the dawn\'s early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight\'s last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, O\'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket\'s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O\'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe\'s haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o\'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning\'s first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: \'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave O\'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle\'s confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps\' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O\'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war\'s desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heav\'n rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: "In God is our trust." And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O\'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!' },

We count our dollars on the train to the party. And everyone who knows us knows that we\'re fine with this, We didn\'t come from money.

Could you beam me up, Give me a minute, I don\'t know what I\'d say in it I\'d probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face Beam me up, Let me be lighter, I\'m tired of being a fighter, I think a minute\'s enough, Just beam me up.  Saw a blackbird soarin\' in the sky, Barely a breath I caught one last sight Tell me that was you sayin\' goodbye, There are times I feel the shiver and cold, It only happens when I\'m on my own, That\'s how you tell me I\'m not alone Could you beam me up, Give me a minute, I don\'t know what I\'d say in it I\'d probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face Beam me up, Let me be lighter, I\'m tired of being a fighter, I think a minute\'s enough, Just beam me up.  In my head I see your baby blues I hear your voice and I, I break in two and now there\'s One of me, with you So when I need you can I send you a sign I\'ll burn a candle and turn off the lights I\'ll pick a star and watch you shine Just beam me up, Give me a minute, I don\'t know what I\'d say in it I\'d probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face Beam me up, Let me be lighter, I\'m tired of being a fighter, I think, a minute\'s enough, Beam me up Beam me up Beam me up Could you beam me up.' },

    lyrics: 'I\'m tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface Don\'t know what you\'re expecting of me Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) I\'ve become so numb, I can\'t feel you there Become so tired, so much more aware I\'m becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you Can\'t you see that you\'re smothering me, Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?  \'Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart right in front of you.  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you.  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) And every second I waste is more than I can take.  I\'ve become so numb, I can\'t feel you there, Become so tired, so much more aware I\'m becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you.  And I know I may end up failing too.  But I know You were just like me with someone disappointed in you.  I\'ve become so numb, I can\'t feel you there, Become so tired, so much more aware.  I\'m becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you.  I\'ve become so numb, I can\'t feel you there.  (I\'m tired of being what you want me to be) I\'ve become so numb, I can\'t feel you there.  (I\'m tired of being what you want me to be)' },

The gangs tried to kill us but we wouldn\'t take flight, brass knuckles and rusty knives keep the wolves at bay and we play in traffic downtown, turn it up and take me away.  What do you do when there\'s nowhere to go? Empty pools and punk rock shows, anger that nobody knows and the sun goes down and the streetlights glow. We rolled through the city in a bucket of rust with the punk rock South Dade girls screaming lyrics at us. From the backseat kicking up dust to the sound of the only people we can trust.  Out of control and you\'ve shivered my timbers, i\'m all fucked up the moon\'s just a sliver yea silence is golden but duct tape is silver like the lining of the clouds that conceal the killers.  The streets aren\'t safe when the winds start blowing, in the eye of the storm the blood starts flowing, we\'re gathering bricks and we\'re gonna start throwing them at you (We\'ll throw them at you) Yea, The streets aren\'t safe when the winds start blowing, in the eye of the storm the blood starts flowing, we\'re gathering bricks and we\'re gonna start throwing them at you (We\'ll throw them at you) Me and Billy like to sleep all day, on the floors where we decay.

Run wild through the streets and sleep with the decay of all that you have left us like fit disarray Out of control and you\'ve shivered my timbers, tell us to shut up and we\'ll give you the finger, yea silence is golden but duct tape is silver silence is golden but duct tape is silver OBEY!' },

And when I think of all the places I just don\'t belong, I\'ve come to grips with life and realize this is going too far.  I don\'t belong here, we gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife.  \'Cause this time I\'m right to move on and on, far away from here.

Of your afterlife here so stay, you\'ll be back here soon anyway.  This peace on earth\'s not right (with my back against the wall).  No pain or sign of time (I\'m much too young to fall).  So out of place don\'t wanna stay, I feel wrong and that\'s my sign.  I\'ve made up my mind.  Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye.  Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life.  I don\'t belong here, I gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife.  \'Cause this time I\'m right to move on and on, far away from here.  Got nothing against you and surely I\'ll miss you.  This place full of peace and light, and I\'d hoped you might, Take me back inside, when the time is right.  Loved ones back home all crying \'cause they\'re already missing me.  I pray by the grace of God that there\'s somebody listening.  Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be.  (I am unbroken, I\'m choking on this ecstasy.) Oh Lord I\'ll try so hard but you gotta let go of me (Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live.) I don\'t belong here, I gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife.  \'Cause this time I\'m right to move on and on, far away from here.  Got nothing against you and surely I\'ll miss you.

What's that, what's a four chord song Benny?  All the greatest hits for the past 40 years just use four chords, same four chords for every song. It's dead simple to write a pop hit.  Just four?  Yeah yeah yeah these four here: E, B, C#m, A Alright let me get this straight here chicken little. What you're trying to say is, you can take those four chords, repeat them, and pump out every pop song ever. Is that's what you're saying?  Yeah Fuck off!  yeah, fuck off... Chicken little.  Just listen Do you recognize this?  Yeah that is Don't Stop Believing by journey (that's a great song) very original song There's a few more that fit, check it out\" My life is brilliant, my love is pure I saw an angel, of that I'm sure People killing people dying Children hurting hear them crying Can you practice what you preach Won't you turn the other cheek Forever young, I want to be Forever young I won't hesitate, no more no more it cannot wait, I'm yours This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending No love no hope no glory, no happy ending Cause you were amazing, and we did amazing things If I could, then I would I'll go wherever you will go And can you feel the love tonight And she will be loved, yes she will be loved Pictures of you, pictures of me Hung up on your wall, for the world to see Cause I can't live, with or without you Whenever I fall, at your feet You let your tears...  Am I not pretty enough Is my heart too bro...  \"Double time?  Double time!\" When I find myself, in times of trouble Mother Mary Comes to me Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner That's the way it's gonna be little darling We'll go riding on the horses Yeah, Yeah No woman no cry Mama this surely is a dream I come from a land down under Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong Take on me (When I come around) Take me on (When I come around) I'll be gone in a day or two Save tonight (Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you) Find the break of dawn (There's nothing that hundred men or more could ever do) If I were a boy (I know she's playing with me) I think I would understand (Well that's ok cause I have no self esteem) With a thousand eyes and a good disguise Hit 'em right between the eyes Hit 'em right between the eyes Cause I'm not here for your entertainment You don't really wanna mess with me tonight Can't read my, can't read my No you can't read my poker face Come on Barbie lets go party Lost and insecure You found me, you found me She wants to touch me wo-hoo She wants to love me wo-hoo She'll never leave me wo-hoo Wo-hoo oh oh Enjoy yourself take only what you need from it Take your canvas bags Take your canvas bags Take your canvas bags to the supermarket Take your canvas bags Nothing's right, I'm torn I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed, into something real I'm wide awake and I can see I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane I'm a bird-plane, I'm a bird-plane A mother fucking bird-plane Doesn't that sound familiar?  Doesn't that hit too close to home?  Doesn't that make you shiver, the way things could've gone?  And doesn't it seem peculiar that everyone wants a little more.

Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' \"This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die\" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx A quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' \"This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die\" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the halftime air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?  We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' \"This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die\" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' \"This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die\" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' \"This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die\" They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' \"This'll be the day that I die\""},

    lyrics: "Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.  Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.  Wouldn't you like to get away?  Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came.  You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same You wanna be where everybody knows Your name.  You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, You wanna go where everybody knows your name.  Full Lyrics never actually aired Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got; Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot.  Wouldn't you like to get away?  All those night when you've got no lights, The check is in the mail; And your little angel Hung the cat up by it's tail; And your third fiance didn't show; Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name, And they're always glad you came; You want to be where you can see, Our troubles are all the same; You want to be where everybody knows your name.  Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; The morning's looking bright; And your shrink ran off to Europe, And didn't even write; And your husband wants to be a girl; Be glad there's one place in the world Where everybody knows your name, And they're always glad you came; You want to go where people know, People are all the same; You want to go where everybody knows your name.  Where everybody knows your name, And they're always glad you came; Where everybody knows your name, And they're always glad you came..."},

So, what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune?\" If I were a rich man, Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum.  All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.  If I were a wealthy man.  I wouldn't have to work hard.  Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.  If I were a biddy biddy rich, Idle-diddle-daidle-daidle man.  I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen, Right in the middle of the town.  A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.  There would be one long staircase just going up, And one even longer coming down, And one more leading nowhere, just for show.  I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks For the town to see and hear.  (Insert)Squawking just as noisily as they can. (End Insert) With each loud \"cheep\" \"sqawk\" \"honk\" \"quack\" Would land like a trumpet on the ear, As if to say \"Here lives a wealthy man.\" If I were a rich man, Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum.  All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.  If I were a wealthy man.  I wouldn't have to work hard.  Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum.  If I were a biddy biddy rich, Idle-diddle-daidle-daidle man.  I'd see my wife, my Golde, looking like a rich man's wife With a proper double-chin.  Supervising meals to her heart's delight.  I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.  Oy, what a happy mood she's in.  Screaming at the servants, day and night.  The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!  They would ask me to advise them, Like a Solomon the Wise.  \"If you please, Reb Tevye...\" \"Pardon me, Reb Tevye...\" Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!  And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.  When you're rich, they think you really know!  If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack To sit in the synagogue and pray.  And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.  And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.  That would be the sweetest thing of all.  If I were a rich man, Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum.  All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.  If I were a wealthy man.  I wouldn't have to work hard.  Idle-diddle-daidle-daidle man.  Lord who mad the lion and the lamb, You decreed I should be what I am.  Would it spoil some vast eternal plan?  If I were a wealthy man."},
