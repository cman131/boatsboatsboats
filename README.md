<h4>Issues</h4>
<p>We have a nice little set of github issues that we mow through pretty quickly. If you want to suggest a feature or log a bug you found go ahead and make an issue. Even if it is something very slight like "the cheating button should be half a pixel taller" We'd love to hear your ideas. Though some suggestions may be challenged, we still enjoy hearing them.</p>
<h4>Pull Requests</h4>
<p>If you want to tackle one of the issues(features, bugs, or tweaks) feel free to make a pull requests. Not all will be approved, but they're welcomed. :) Make sure that there is an issue for what your pull request will alter and reference it in the PR description.</p>
<h4>I just want my song in...</h4>
<p>Unfortunately we still aren't using an api for the lyrics. Maybe because someone stubbornly won't let other folks work on it... but meh. Until then, you can get a song in by making an issue and waiting or making a pull request for the issue. All the songs are just in a big js array in songs.js ( Ugly I know :( , but hopefully temporary )</p>
